## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WhyWatchOS_1/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.

[Home repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/tree/WacOS-dev/WatchOS/1/)
